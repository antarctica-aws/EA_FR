Please note: the code has not been amended for wider use and still contains set working directories for use with University of Maryland systems, you will need to change these for the scripts to run. 

The product generation and analysis of this project were conducted using a combination of programming languages in order to optimize computation efficiency as well as to reduce data storage costs. Overall, the processing of GEDI data, machine learning model development, and aboveground biomass map generation were carried out in Python (3.7). The processing of Landsat data and derivation of predictor variables were carried out in Google Earth Engine. The econometric analysis using staggered difference-in-difference was conducted in R (3.6). The data visualizations were conducted in both R (3.6) and QGIS 3.
The entire workflow, including the steps each script corresponds to, is listed and described in the Google doc linked here (including link to the Google Earth Engine code used for Landsat preprocessing). https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KfPpar_GFpNAubiA-AooinbYy9-FDujYJvpFDH6fwQg/edit?usp=sharing
